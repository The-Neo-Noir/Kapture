# Kapture
Eclipse plugin that shows the shortcuts taken. Helps learning and for demo purposes. 

If you are in code pairing environment you would wish to know the shortcuts taken by your peer it would be helpful to see what shortcut is taken on the screen, instead of gazing at the keystokes. The other useful environment is for the code presentors or tutors who use screen capture to display the live code.
